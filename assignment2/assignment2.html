            <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>    
            <h2> The Goal</h2>
            <p> 
                For this project, I wanted to find a website to redesign, but I also wanted the website I chose to be a 
                website that is important to me. Therefore, I decided to choose the website of a place that I visited often as 
                a child. This is that site. 
            </p>
            <a href="http://www.skatetownknox.com">Original Website</a>
            <img alt="SkateTown Original Image" src="skatetown_original.png" id="orig-site">

            <h2> Design Issues</h2>
            <p> 
                When you look at the image above what is the first thing that pops into your head? 
                If you are like me, then the first thing was probably the hideous design of the website. 
                It isn't necessarily hard to navigate since there is so little content, but it is painful to 
                look at and at times hard to read due to the colors chosen for the design
            </p>
            <h3> Issues</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The images are vastly outdated and not at all modern. In fact, they look like something you would see in a commercial from the 90s</li>
                <li>In fact, the entire website looks outdated. In my opinion, this makes it feel sketchy which is not something that should be associated with a business</li>
                <li>The website is clustered with unnecessary colors which don't necessarily complement each other.</li>
                <li>When you click on @Skatetownknox it calls their phone number which is undesired behavior.</li>
                <li>They tell you their social media information when they could link it which would make people more likely to follow them on instagram and facebook</li>
                <li>A lot of the tabs in the menu lead towards information that is either repetitive or just doesn't add value to the site</li>
                <li>The hours panel is on top of the blue bar when it should be below it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2> Accessibility Issues</h2>
            <p> 
                Futhermore, there are also some issues with accessibility that can make it hard for screen readers to both navigate and read the content.
            </p>
            <h3> Issues</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>None of the images have alt text which means that a screen reader will not be able to read anything for an image</li>
                <li>The html content is disorganized and things that should be hea</li>
                <li>The contrast between yellow and pink can make it difficult to see the hours that the skating rink is open</li>
                <li> A lot of the text is separated into multiple paragraph tags when it is really one paragraph which makes it difficult for screen readers because the screen reader will break and continue reading at weird places</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="part2">
            <h2>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h2>
            <p> In hopes of fixing some of these issues, I first designed three different lo-fi protypes of what a potential redesign of the website might look like. The first prototype details what a potential design for mobile view might look like with larger text, wrapping flex boxes and a drop down menu. The second and third prototype details tablets and desktop views and are mostly similar with the only real difference being font size. Both of these designs feature a menu bar with less cluster and an improved hours container. Futhermore, the social media is linked and can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding icon. Finally, there is an improved image with alt text.

            <h2>Visual Style Guide</h2>
            <p>I wanted to make the website feel less outdated, and easier on the eyes, and to do this. I needed a new color pallete on top of new icons. Therefore, I created a visual guide to help show off these new design choices.</p>
            <img src="style-guide.png" alt="Style-guide">
            <h2>Hi-Fi Prototyping</h2>
            <p> After I designed the low fidelity protypes, the next thing that I needed to do was to develop a high fidelity protype for all 3 devices. By creating the low-fidelity prototypes, I had an idea of the layout that I wanted for the improved website design, but now I needed to think of the colors that I wanted for these prototypes.</p>

            <h2><a href="skatetown.html" id="final-link">The Final Product</a></h2>
            <p> Now that I had finished creating both the low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes. It was finally time to start coding the website. I started by writing the website in html and grouping the content together using divs, so that I could easily position it later using css. Now that I had the content, it was time to begin start making the website vibrant. Utilizing the color pallete that I had used for the high fidelity prototype, I began to make the website the way I had wanted to. Along the way, I had to deviate slightly from the original prototypes due to some things being harder to do than expected and other deviations were just design choices that I thought looked better. After several changes, I had finally created the improved website, and I am happy with the results.</p>
